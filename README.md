## Objective of Application
Tired of people saying "I'll be there in 5 minutes" when you know perfectly that they are probably still getting ready?<br/>
The lies are over with this application!<br/>
This application is made for (in this instance) PokemonGo users to converge on a location at a set time for a "Raid".<br/>
First, the user must sign-up and/or log-in to the application. Once the user is logged in, he can then access the application. Initially the view will be a map centered on the users location.<br/>
From this page, the user can modify his profile, log out, add a "Marker" to signal an incoming event, view already created locations and re-center the map on his location if need be.

# Functionalities

 ### UserPage
 On the user profile page, the user can modify his userName and level in case the information needs to be updated.
 ### Locations
 On the locations page, users can view the location names, and click on various locations to view more detailed information.
 #### Location
 Once on a specific location page, users can signal themselve as en route to location, which then adds them to a list of users serving to display itineraries from all users coming to said location.
