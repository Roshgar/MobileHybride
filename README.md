## Objective of Application
Tired of people saying "I'll be there in 5 minutes" when you know perfectly that they are probably still getting ready?<br/>
The lies are over with this application!<br/>
This application is made for (in this instance) PokemonGo users to converge on a location at a set time for a "Raid".<br/>
First, the user must sign-up and/or log-in to the application. Once the user is logged in, he can then access the application. Initially the view will be a map centered on the users location.<br/>
From this page, the user can modify his profile, log out, add a "Marker" to signal an incoming event, view already created locations and re-center the map on his location if need be.
