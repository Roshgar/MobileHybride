## Objective of Application
Tired of people saying "I'll be there in 5 minutes" when you know perfectly well that they are probably still getting ready? Fret not! The lies are over with this application!
This application is made for (in this instance) pokemonGo users to converge on a location at a set time for a "raid".
First, the user must sign-up and/or log-in to the application.
Once the user is logged in, he can then acces the application. Initially the view will be a map centered on the users location. From this page, the user can modify his profile, add a "Marker" to signal an incoming event, view already created locations and re-center the map if need be.

 ### UserPage
 On the user profile page, the user can modify his userName and level in case the information needs to be updated.
 ### Locations
 On the locations page, users can view the location names, and click on various locations to view more detailed information.
 #### Location
 Once on a specific location page, users can signal themselve as en route to location, which then adds them to a list of users serving to display itineraries from all users coming to said location.
